# üé® Raytrace
A Raycast theme for Flow Launcher.

Raycast is a phenomenal app launcher with a beautiful, modern design. Sadly, it is currently only available for macOS, with no plans to port it to Windows or any other OS for that matter. More info: {https://youtu.be/Lr7etNkQIsM?t=99}

(Note: their reasoning is that you can't port Swift applications to non-Apple platforms, but, rather ironically, Arc Browser from The Browser Company claims to be doing just that. More info: {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa_fNuaSE_I})
